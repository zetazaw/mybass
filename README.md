| **Warm-up & Dexterity (7 mins)**     | Left Hand: Chromatic Walk (1234) on lower strings. <br> Right Hand: Open String Alternation (i-m-i-m) on 5th & 4th strings, focusing on consistent tone & rest stroke. | Left Hand: "Spider" Variation (1234) on 6th string. <br> Right Hand: Open String Alternation on all lower strings, focusing on evenness between fingers. Dynamic control (soft/loud). | Choose 1-2 challenging exercises from Day 1/2. Focus on fluid finger movement and precise right-hand mechanics (alternation, rest stroke, thumb position). |
| **Rhythm & Timing (10 mins)**        | Left Hand: Root notes for 12-bar blues in A (A, D, E) â€“ quarter notes, then eighth notes. <br> Right Hand: Consciously use alternating fingers, ensure rest stroke on the next string for basic muting. Play along with slow blues backing track. | Left Hand: Quarter & Eighth Note Variations on open string, with metronome. <br> Right Hand: Focus on push/pull of beat, precise placement. Accent practice (every beat, 1 & 3). Introduce "swing" feel for eighth notes. | Both Hands: Groove with drum machine/backing track. Play simple patterns (root notes, root-fifth). <br> Right Hand: Focus on "locking in" precisely with the drums. Experiment with playing slightly ahead/behind/on the beat. |
| **Patterns/Song Focus (10 mins)**    | Left Hand: Basic Blues Root-Fifth Pattern (A-E) on 6th & 5th strings. Simple descending walking line (A-G-F#-E). <br> Right Hand: Deliberate thumb muting of lower strings when playing higher strings. Practice the rest stroke for muting the string below. | Left Hand: Basic Jazz Major 7th Arpeggios (C-E-G-B). Introduction to playing root notes with jazz backing track, then trying to add a simple leading note. <br> Right Hand: Focused muting as you switch strings during arpeggios (thumb shifts, rest stroke). Consistent alternation. | Both Hands: Learn a very simple blues or jazz song/bass line (e.g., "So What" intro, simple 12-bar blues line). Break into small sections. <br> Right Hand: Self-critique: consistent alternation, even tone, effective muting of all unwanted string noise. Address tension. |
| **Listen & Review (3 mins)**         | Listen to a blues/jazz bass player. Pay attention to their tone, rhythm, and contribution. Visualize your right hand playing. | Listen to a jazz standard. Try to identify the bass line's general approach and right-hand technique. | Review what felt good/challenging. Plan for next session. Listen to chosen song, visualize playing the bass part. |
